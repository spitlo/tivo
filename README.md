# Tivo

These are the latest updates from some YT channels I follow. Updated every hour.

## Todo

- [x] Add Tiny Desk Concerts?
- [ ] Use [Retro Reports Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4CGYNsoW2iAOqPtxm4RHo205w_R1IWuH) instead of the full New York Times channel?

## Note to self

To find a feed ID, view source on a channel/playlist and search for `browseId`. Is there an easier way?
