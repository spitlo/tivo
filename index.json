          "A meet-cute, an intriguing drink order and a stealth character in the background make for a clever scene in Celine Song’s latest film, “Materialists.” Narrating this sequence, the writer-director said she chose this particular scene to discuss for this series “because it’s the first scene that I wrote.”\n\nIn it, Harry, played by Pedro Pascal, is at the reception following his brother’s wedding. He rearranges his name card so he can sit next to Lucy (Dakota Johnson), a matchmaker he quickly starts to hit on.\n\nDiscussing the scene, Song said she wanted the camera to settle on a long two-shot, in which Lucy and Harry have a thoughtful conversation.\n\n“This really reflects how incredible my actors are,” she said, “because we’re really treating them like they’re theater actors having to have a whole conversation while sitting in this two-shot.”\n\nDuring that discussion, Song adds to the narrative with a background moment, a quick introduction of the film’s third lead, John (Chris Evans), who walks through the frame while the two are talking.\n\n“I really did want the sound design and the way that he walks by to be something that is maybe not easy to spot in the first watch, but it’s a bit of a secret.”\n\nThat moment pays off when Lucy tells Harry her drink order toward the end of the scene.\n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n\nMore from The New York Times Video: http://nytimes.com/video\n----------\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world. It's all the news that's fit to watch."

          "This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk honors the anniversaries of landmark albums that have shaped the course of music and culture.\n\nAshley Pointer | June 13, 2025\nCeCe Winans' voice transcends genre, race and generations — something incredibly rare in the gospel and Christian music realms. Her Tiny Desk concert, which celebrates the 30th anniversary of her solo debut Alone in His Presence, is a moving journey through the many eras of her monumental career.\n\nWinans laughed when she told me, \"Ashley, you had me working today!\" She dusted off songs she hadn't performed in decades to craft this moment. (And that's without even touching the groundbreaking work she did alongside her brother BeBe Winans.) From the joyous call and response of \"Pray\" to the crowd's audible gasp at the opening line of \"Alabaster Box\" to the heartfelt \"Goodness of God\" singalong, this performance isn't just nostalgic, it's a reminder of Winans' enduring spiritual and cultural impact. She is one of the most decorated gospel artists of all time — witness a living legend take the Tiny Desk to church.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Well, Alright\"\n\"Pray\"\n\"I Am\"\n\"More Than What I Wanted\"\n\"Alone in the Presence\"\n\"Alabaster Box\"\n\"Believe For It\"\n\"Come Jesus Come\"\n\"Goodness of God\"\n\"That's My King\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCeCe Winans: vocals\nThomas Hardin Jr.: keys, music director\nTyrone Jackson: guitar, music director\nTJ Fuller: bass\nAllen Mabson: drums\nBrandon Newsome: percussion\nChristi Richardson: background vocals\nChaunda Jefferson: background vocals\nCeCe Dunn: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Ashley Pointer\nDirector: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Neil Tevault\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Editor: Maia Stern\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Mitra I.

          "This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk honors the anniversaries of landmark albums that have shaped the course of music and culture.\n\nAlanté Serene | June 6, 2025\nWhen Amerie arrived at the Tiny Desk, her enthusiastic energy and bright smile was an instant mood boost. The warm entrance felt fitting for an artist whose music embodies the soul of summer: bold percussion, breezy vocals and the feeling of endless possibilities.\n\nWhen her sophomore album Touch dropped in 2005, it introduced a national audience to the infectious rhythms of go-go. Rooted in Washington, D.C., go-go is known for its layered percussion, funky basslines and live instrumentation made to hype the crowd. These sounds pulse through Amerie's music and helped to make \"1 Thing\" a standout in a year overflowing with R&B hits.\n\nAmerie, who once lived in Washington, D.C. for several years, returns to the city with a reimagined set accompanied by go-go legends Backyard Band. Together, they open the show with songs from her debut album All I Have, including \"Talkin' to Me\" and the quintessential summer anthem \"Why Don't We Fall in Love.\" She eases into her latest single, \"Mine,\" and delivers a fan-favorite \"I Just Died,\" before introducing a new rendition of \"Rolling Down My Face\" that you'll want to hear all the time from now on. By the time \"Talkin' About\" kicks in, Amerie is in full dance mode. When \"1 Thing\" closes out the set, she steps from behind the Desk to join the dance party, turning the performance into a celebration.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Talkin' to Me\"\n\"Why Don't We Fall in Love\"\n\"Mine\"\n\"I Just Died\"\n\"Rolling Down My Face\"\n\"Talkin' About\"\n\"1 Thing\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAmerie: vocals\nWarren Jones: keys \nMichael Dunklin: keys\nEric Britt: keys\nBobby Terry: guitar\nEugene Chapman: alto saxophone\nNathaniel Fields: bass\nPaul Edwards: drums\nKeith Robinson: percussion\nTanesia Mack: background vocals\nTonaee' Burgess: background vocals\nZay'Marie: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Alanté Serene\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Elizabeth Gillis\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #amerie \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

They're everywhere, from TV, to movies, to books. But not music. It's not that it never happens, but it's really rare compared to most other mainstream art forms, and as a true believer in the narrative potential of music, I find that kinda disappointing.

          "Mitra I. Arthur | May 21, 2025\nYes, ARTEMIS is named for a Greek goddess. This jazz supergroup has super powers and they're on full display from beginning to end during this Tiny Desk. The multi-generational and multinational group is composed of pianist Renee Rosnes, drummer (and Tiny Desk alum) Allison Miller, bassist Noriko Ueda, trumpeter Ingrid Jensen and tenor saxophonist Nicole Glover, all bandleaders with their own prolific outputs.\n\nHere the quintet presents three original selections from their latest album, ARBORESQUE. \"Olive Branch,\" a composition from musical director Rosnes, opens the set. Solos from her and Ueda provide the soil and roots, respectively, in which a trumpet solo from Jensen, then a dynamic solo from Miller, flourish. Miller's meditative \"Little Cranberry\" features soothing solos from Rosnes and Glover. It fades out in calming fashion to prepare you for Jensen's high energy closer, \"Sights Unseen,\" which erupts in a dizzying flurry of Tilt-A-Whirl-esque solos from Jensen, Glover and Rosnes that take you on a ride you won't want to get off.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Olive Branch\"\n\"Little Cranberry\"\n\"Sights Unseen\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nRenee Rosnes: piano\nNicole Glover: tenor saxophone\nIngrid Jensen: trumpet\nNoriko Ueda: bass\nAllison Miller: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Mitra I.

          "Bobby Carter | April 28, 2025\nFor Madison McFerrin to deliver the proper experience of her live show at the Tiny Desk, she wanted to be sure she had the freedom to use the instruments that helped identify her. The LA-based singer has become well-known for looping vocals over and over again; thus, creating instruments in real-time. To celebrate her upcoming album, SCORPIO, McFerrin brings a Chicago-based band led by Kameron Lowe and featuring The Lovely Lowe Sisters on background vocals. \n\nGiven her family history, McFerrin’s dive into the music business was a foregone conclusion. She and her brothers Taylor and Jevon chose entertainment as a career, taking after their father, Bobby McFerrin, who famously recorded the groundbreaking hit “Don’t Worry Be Happy” in 1988. Before playing her latest single, “I Don’t,” she mentions them all while serving up some “McFerrin tea.” “My mother is seemingly the only one with any sense because she’s the only one out of the five of us who hasn’t been engaged more than once.”\n\nSET LIST\n\"No Time to Lose\"\n“OMW”\n\"Ain't It Nice\"\n\"I Don't\"\n\"TRY\"\n\"Run It Back\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMadison McFerrin: vocals, electronics\nKameron Lowe: keys, piano, music director\nAshton Lowery: guitar\nBrooklynn Skye: bass\nDonis: drums\nKristen Lowe: background vocals\nShantina Lowe: background vocals\nKymbriel Lowe: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideo Editor: Joshua Bryant\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Alanté Serene\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #madisonmcferrin\n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

          "Thank you to Bombas for sponsoring this video! Head to https://bombas.com/diggingthegreats and use code DIGGINGTHEGREATS at checkout for 20% off your first purchase.\n\nLupe Fiasco’s 2006 song “Kick, Push” is a classic, and the first official single of his career, putting him on the map - but - the song was never actually meant to be a single. It was never meant to be more than a song made for a skateboarding DVD. Today we’re breaking down “Kick Push” - the story behind it, recreating the beat from the original sample, analyzing the lyrics, and seeing how this Skateboarding DVD song took Lupe Fiasco all the way to the Grammys.\n\nNOTE: My recreation got flagged, and since it was blocking the video in some territories, I had to remove it.\n\nWatch the Extended edit of this video ad-free and support the channel by becoming a member at http://www.patreon.com/diggingthegreats\n\n__________________________________\nFOLLOW DIGGING THE GREATS\nhttps://www.instagram.com/diggingthegreats/\nhttp://www.patreon.com/diggingthegreats\n\nDigging The Greats Podcast - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/digging-the-greats/id1694172577\nInterview Channel -  @DiggingTheTalks  \n\n__________________________________\nTHANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER TIER ON PATREON \nSam Deka\nJosh Nelson\nD.

          "I live in an endless void of my own creation.\nSupport 12tone on Patreon to help us keep making cool videos! https://www.patreon.com/12tonevideos\nWatch this video on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/12tone-i-listened-to-one-song-on-repeat-for-a-month\n\nThis was a... surprising experience. I'm always looking for ways to become a more engaged music listener, and one of the best ones I've found is listening games. I do these fairly often in my personal life, picking some restriction and making myself do it for a while to see what happens, but now that it's become a part of my musical practice I wanted to talk about it in a video, and to do that I had to pick something really ambitious, and long story short I wound up listening to a single song, over and over, every day for a month to see how that repeated exposure changed my experience of it. I did a lot of active listening exercises along the way, approaching it from every angle I could think of, and in one of my longest videos ever, I want to talk about what that was like and, more importantly, all the things I learned.\n\nMerch: https://store.nebula.tv/12tone\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pq2QBEw\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/12tone.nebula.tv\nEmail: 12tonevideos@gmail.com\n\nScript: https://tinyurl.com/4dweafbs\n\nAnd thanks as well to Henry Reich, Jon Hancock, Eugene Bulkin, Adam Neely, Dave Mayer, OrionWolfie, CodenaCrow, Arnas, Caroline Simpson, Michael Alan Dorman, Blake Boyd, Charles Gaskell, Tom Evans, David Conrad, Ducky, Nikolay Semyonov, h2g2guy, Andrew Engel, Peter Brinkmann, naomio, Alex Mole, Betsy, Tonya Custis, Graeme Lewis, Jake Sand, Scott Albertine, Conor Stuart Roe, ZagOnEm, רועי סיני, Brian Miller, Thomas Morgan, Serena Crocker, Adam Ziegenhals, Mark, Amelia Lewis, Justin St John-Brooks, DialMForManning, Andrew Wyld, JD White, Graham Orndorff, gunnito, Kyle Kinkaid, Foreign Man in a Foreign Land, Tom, Andy Maurer, Don Jennings, Cormag81, Derek H., Bryan, Mikeyxote, Dan Whitmer, FAD3 Chaos, Michael Morris, Bill Owens, Martin Romano, George Burgyan, Flavor Dave, Marc Testart, DraconicDon, Megan Oberfield, morolin, An Oni Moose, Ken Birdwell, Blue 5alamander, Cliff Hudson, Ethan Savaglio, Robert Bailey, Donald Murray, juneau, Sina Bahram, Ira Kroll, Patrick Minton, Justin Katz, Roahn Wynar, Bob D'Errico, Robert Shaw, David Shlapak, JD, Rennie Allen, Travis Briggs, Greyson Erickson, Strife, Brian Covey, Jay Harris, Sean Murphy, JasperJackal, Tommy Transplant, Wolfgang Giersche, Olaf, Billy Abbott, Gil, d0d63, Jon Purdy, Ken Brown, Colin Kennedy, The Mauses, christopher porto, William Wallace, Karel P Kerezman, Ted Trainor, Antarct, mightstill, Nick Loh, Randy Thomson, Mikaela, Erika Lee, Aenne Brielmann, Emma Finch, Klaus, Fefe Magalhaes, Andrew F.

We used it to ping a filter, the Serge Random Source Variable Q VCF, which we then processed with Intellijel's Rainmaker which we could trigger to have all its parameters randomized at once.\n\nAt different points we used sequencing or gesture controls via 0-CTRL to modulate the filter's cutoff and Rainmaker's comb filter feedback.\n\nWe multed the resulting audio to a VCA so we could control its amplitude with a percussive envelope, and then used a switch (WMD Sequential Switch Matrix) to alternate between the original audio and then enveloped audio, sometimes via sequencing and sometimes by hand.\n\n★ Socials ★\n\nInstagram http://instagram.com/andrewismusic\nTikTok https://vm.tiktok.com/weEbNK/\nFacebook http://facebook.com/andrewismusic\n\n★ Stream My Music ★\n\nSpotify http://spoti.fi/2pF0qRB\nApple https://music.apple.com/us/artist/andrew-huang/130057628\nBandcamp http://bit.ly/2oRWCby\nTidal https://tidal.com/browse/artist/4956795\n\n★ Software & Equipment ★\n\nDisclosure: Most of these are affiliate links - if you buy anything through them (even if it's not the linked item) I'll receive a small percentage, which helps support my channel.\n\nMy most used plugins https://www.pluginboutique.com/articles/1780?a_aid=51e478dc\nMy music software https://www.ableton.com/shop/live/?affiliate=TlTs9eL4\nSmall audio interface https://amzn.to/2H7x4mx\nBig audio interface https://www.perfectcircuit.com/ua-apollo-x8p-heritage.html?utm_source=pepperjam&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=241038&clickId=4977028111\nModular https://www.pntrac.com/t/TUJGR0tHS0JHSUZFSE1CR0hMRUZL\nHeadphones - lots of hype https://amzn.to/2JmTmDK\nHeadphones - low latency wireless https://fas.st/t/2JhrAk9k\nHeadphones - super pro omg https://amzn.to/2VOcmjz\nHow I learned synthesis https://bit.ly/2PROCoT\nMain camera https://amzn.to/3FngomP\n2nd camera http://amzn.to/2aHkv35\n\nI use Distrokid to get my music on streaming platforms - get 7% off your first year here: http://distrokid.com/vip/huang\n\nChapters\n0:00 Intro to our noise making game!\n0:31 Turn 1\n1:27 Turn 2\n2:02 Turn 3 & new game rules?\n3:06 Turn 4\n3:54 Turn 5\n5:20 Turn 6 & new-new game rules?\n5:57 Turn ??\n6:54 Free software version of our patch!\n7:16 Final thoughts"

Then why are billions suddenly being pumped into fusion startups? Yes to train LLMs, but there's a reason the technobrats are bullish on fusion in particular. The fact is, the technological challenges have been chipped away and in many cases solved over the past decades, and there's really no one deal-breaker difficulty remaining. One of the final challenges is deciding on the physical vessel to contain our mini artificial stars--and we have some pretty sci-fi options that are nearly ready to go.\n\nPBS Member Stations rely on viewers like you.

          "Elle Mannion | May 29, 2025\nWe received nearly 7,500 entries from independent artists across the country for the Tiny Desk Contest. That’s a record for the project, now in its 11th year, which has catapulted the careers of artists like Grammy winners Fantastic Negrito and Tank and the Bangas. Now we have a new star: Ruby Ibarra, a Filipina American rapper from the Bay Area. Ibarra’s Contest entry, “Bakunawa,” stunned this year’s panel of judges with its multilingual, intergenerational band and passionate emcee.\n\nWhen arriving at the Tiny Desk, Ibarra was poised, gracious and a little reserved. We could tell she was taking in the moment that she would later call “surreal.” But as soon as she got situated behind the Desk, she locked in. \n\nCommunity and culture are two guiding forces in Ibarra’s music. She put together an all-Filipino band for this performance, which includes R&B singer Ouida and members of Pinay Voltron and Astralogik, plus rock legend June Millington. But beyond these musicians, Ibarra’s crew runs deep; our office was packed with the artists’ friends and family. \n\nOn “Bakunawa,” a song about Filipino folklore and motherhood, Ibarra performs in English, Tagalog and Bisaya, switching effortlessly between the three languages from one verse to the next. On “7000 Miles,” she raps about her and her family’s experiences as immigrants. “My mom will make it in America” is a verse she repeats while looking into the teary eyes of her mother, who sits front row in the audience with a box of tissues. At the end of “Someday,” Ibarra changes the song’s refrain from “Mama, we gon’ make it here someday” to “Mama, we gon’ make it here today.”\n\nBetween flows, Ibarra introduces herself and makes a statement: “Being human is not illegal. Immigrants have been here, lived here, worked here. And this immigrant is here. From Tacloban City, Philippines, all the way to Washington, D.C., my name is Ruby Ibarra.”\n\nSET LIST\n“Bakunawa” \n“7000 Miles”\n“Someday”\n\nMUSICIANS\nRuby Ibarra: vocals\nOuida: vocals\nJune Millington: guitar, vocals\nAnna Macan: guitar, background vocals\nCamille Ramirez: bass, flute, background vocals\nAngelo “LASI” Macaraeg: keys, guitar\nJoJo Gajardo Ramirez: drums\nCharito Soriano: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Elle Mannion, Bobby Carter\nDirector: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nTiny Desk Contest Team: Elle Mannion, Dora Levite, Otis Hart\nVideo Editor: Sofia Seidel\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Engineer: Neil Tevault\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #tinydeskcontest #rubyibarra\n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

For example: \"Pleasure's a sin, and sometimes sin's a pleasure\" - Lord Byron.\n\nIn \"chiasmus,\" similar concepts or grammatical structures are repeated and reversed, but not necessarily the same words. For example: \"It's HARD to MAKE time, but to WASTE it is EASY\"\n\n🎷"

          "This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk honors the anniversaries of landmark albums that have shaped the course of music and culture.\n\nBobby Carter | June 10, 2025\nWiz Khalifa’s Kush & Orange Juice came out 15 years ago. To honor the anniversary, the Pittsburgh emcee assembled a group of Tiny Desk veterans, Pennsylvania natives and his DJ to reimagine highlights from the classic mixtape, plus tracks from Kush & Orange Juice 2, its similar, yet more mature follow-up.\n\nSomething was happening during the entire show and lots of us in the room could feel it. We were waiting for him to engage with us, but he didn’t. I stepped in after a few songs to remind him that it was OK to do so — still, nothing. But then, after “Crime Bud and Women,” Wiz spoke to the audience for the first and only time, wiping away tears: “You made me cry. F*** y’all!” \n\nI can muster up a few guesses as to why the emotion overflowed. Wiz had a host of family and friends present in this very intimate setting, including his father. And he did tell me how much he loves performing.

Head to https://away.yt.link/n15K3XF to get 10% off your first order at Away!\n\nThe Dr. Dre song “Still Dre” is a West Coast CLASSIC - That ironically has a lot of east coast influence in it. Well, not just influence, it’s kind of actually an east coast song. I know, I’m coming out swinging - but hear me out.\n\nWe’re going to break this song down, and I mean alllll the way down. Like maybe I went too far with this breakdown, I dunno, you be the judge.\n\nSupport the channel and watch the Extended Edit which is longer, has more music, and is Ad-Free by becoming a Patreon member: http://www.patreon.com/diggingthegreats\n\n__________________________________\nFOLLOW DIGGING THE GREATS\nhttps://www.instagram.com/diggingthegreats/\nhttp://www.patreon.com/diggingthegreats\n\nDigging The Greats Podcast - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/digging-the-greats/id1694172577\nInterview Channel -  @DiggingTheTalks  \n\n__________________________________\nTHANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER TIER ON PATREON \nSam Deka\nJosh Nelson\nD.

          "Elle Mannion | May 9, 2025\nKatie Gavin is the kind of performer whose dynamism knows no bounds. Whether she’s performing with her pop band MUNA or solo, Gavin is a captivating presence. \n\nEach of the four songs Gavin plays from her folksy record, What a Relief, have ambitious and honest lyrics, yet no two songs sound the same. “Aftertaste” serves as a bridge between MUNA’s sound and Gavin’s solo work. “The Baton” is a violin-forward reflection on intergenerational trauma. “Sanitized” is groovy and introspective. And Gavin’s performance of “Sketches” puts her on par with the Lilith Fair artists whose sounds inspired her album. \n\n“This whole solo record was very, like, experimental and playful,” says Gavin as she shifts between the violin, piano and guitar. “I'm playing a lot of instruments that I don't really play,” she admits — though you wouldn’t guess that by the way she casually slays a violin solo or plays the piano with her eyes closed. \n\nBefore “Sketches,” a song that deals with the theme of love versus fear, Gavin gives a moving speech about what it’s like to live in the overwhelming world we’re in right now. Gavin then mentions that she’s been talking to a young girl in Gaza, who she asked if she wanted to share anything with the audience. “She told me that she wanted to say that, despite everything, she still believes in life, and she knows that there are people in this world whose hearts are full of compassion,” says Gavin. “And if she can share that and believe in that, then it makes me believe I definitely can, too.” \n\nSET LIST\n“The Baton”\n“Sanitized”\n“Sketches”\n“Aftertaste”\n\nMUSICIANS\nKatie Gavin: vocals, guitar, violin\nEric Radloff: guitar, percussion, background vocals\nNana Adjoa: bass, shruti box, piano, background vocals\nSarab Singh: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Elle Mannion\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josephine Nyounai\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Mhari Shaw\nTiny Desk Team: Lars Gotrich, Ashley Pointer, Josh Newell\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #katiegavin"

          "Learn More About Anydesk: https://anydesk.com/spacetime \n\nAccording to quantum physics, the universe should have collapsed on itself in the instant after the Big Bang due to all particles being 100 million billion times heavier. Recent observations of the universe existing suggest that this may not have happened. Even more recent experiments at the Large Hardron Collider have failed to find out why. In particular, why the Higgs boson is light enough to allow the universe to exist. This is part of something known as the hierarchy problem, and some consider it to be the most important unsolved problem in physics.\n\n\nPBS Member Stations rely on viewers like you.

Tobin is 7 years old, and was found as a stray and spent 8 months in the shelter before I came to pick him up. He’s great with all humans (including kids!) and is the kind of dog that would be amazing at a hospital because all he wants is to gently push his big head into a stranger while they give him butt rubs. He gets along great with my cat and my other dog Scraps after a slow introduction. He’s hard of hearing and has arthritis so no big hikes, but if you need someone to awkwardly scoot up next to you while you watch a movie, he’s the best in the game. Email me at apply@simonegiertz.com. Preferably people in California, but open to other locations for the right home!"

          "Mitra I. Arthur | May 19, 2025\nIn Death Becomes Her, the main characters kill each other multiple times … for laughs! Robert Zemeckis' 1992 film is a cult classic; its stage adaptation — with a book by Marco Pennette and lyrics and music by Julia Mattison and Noel Carey — is a delightfully unhinged musical that I knew needed the Tiny Desk treatment. But If you're wondering if the performers recreate any of the physical comedy gags in the NPR Music office, you'll have to head to the theater.\n\nMattison and Carey were on hand to shepherd the Tiny Desk audience through the world they helped create. Michelle Williams (of Destiny's Child fame) plays Viola Van Horn, the potion slinging sorceress, with enticing mystique; she performs \"If You Want Perfection\" and reminds us that actions have consequences in the grooving \"Don't Say I Didn't (Warn You).\" In \"Tell Me, Ernest,\" Megan Hilty (Madeline Ashton), Jennifer Simard (Helen Sharp) and Christopher Sieber (Dr. Ernest Menville) bring the weird and competitive love triangle of their characters to life (with a memorable appearance from Josh Lamon). Despite the fact their characters' \"hatred escalated into murder\" a few times, Hilty and Simard showcase their dysfunctional and codependent love for each other in the show's 11 o'clock number, \"Alive Together.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"If You Want Perfection\"\n\"Tell Me, Ernest\"\n\"Alive Forever\" \n\"Don't Say I Didn't (Warn You)\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMichelle Williams: vocals\nJennifer Simard: vocals\nMegan Hilty: vocals\nChristopher Sieber: vocals\nNoel Carey: keys, background vocals\nJulia Mattison: cowbell, background vocals\nDillon Kondor: guitar\nRob Jost: bass\nBen Cohn: keys\nDamien Bassman: drums\nJosh Lamon: background vocals\nTaurean Everett: background vocals\nXimone Rose: background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Mitra I.

In a contract, the buyer is obligated to buy the asst, and an option frees them of that obligation. \n\n- The wealth generated in the 1950's can also be greatly contributed to much of Europe's destruction and how America used that as leverage to lend money under the condition of the US dollar being standardized for trade. This is a fascinating hour long video in itself. \n\n- I anticipate that a portion of viewers will argue that this is just a new phase of capitalism. I disagree, but delving further into that disagreement requires further analyzing the semantic definition of \"capitalism\", which is probably a waste of time. So whether this is a new thing that doesn't have a name or a new mutation of capitalism that doesn't have a name, both are correct in describing the circumstances. \n\n- Bitcoin would've been a great answer to a lot of these problems. Unfortunately it's not used as a currency, but as a prospective asset. If it's not replacing the US dollar enmasse, it's not a solution to anything in this video. In fact, it makes a lot of this worse when you consider the insane amount of alt-coins. \n\nFurther viewing: \n- There is no higher recommendation on YouTube than  @PBoyle  for anything related to finance or economic history. \n\n- Adam Curtis (BBC, etc) makes films that provide excellent surreal recaps of recent history that absolutely inspire me greatly. \n\nLOTS of books I recommend:\n- Technofuedalism is an excellent and accessible book about this from Yanis Varoufakis. It's actually a bit more far-reaching (and scary) than my conclusions in this video. \n\nAll of the following inspired this video: \n- The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff\n- Platform Capitalism by Nick Srnicek\n- The Attention Merchants by Tim Wu\n- New Dark Age by James Bridle\n- Capital is Dead: Is this something worse? by McKenzie Wark\n\nFinally, there are too many books to name about WWII and the Soviet Union that fascinate me endlessly. There is so much to learn those time-encapsulated parallel economies. \n\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Intro\n1:43 - CH1 Capitalism (A Eulogy)\n9:23 - CH2 History Repeats Itself\n19:33 - CH3 Post Capitalism\n26:27 - CH4 Digital Sharecropping\n36:10 - Conclusions"

Arduino handles logic and outputs MIDI to an OXI Coral synth module. 6 channels / 8 voices (basslines, pads, melodies, arpeggios, percussions, kicks)\n\nThe machine is very sparse interaction-wise - A volume knob, some controls for optional ambience(FX Aid XL module) and a reset switch. Parameters such as BPM and scales are randomly picked upon each reset, generating something fresh that slowly evolves over time.\n\nA variety of moving components mimic MIDI activity on different channels, a totem visualizer where mechanics and sound combine."

Use our link https://joinnautilus.com/SABINE to get 15% off your membership!\n\nDark energy and dark matter are two placeholders for mysterious forces and substances that expand our universe and make up the majority of its matter, respectively. In a new theory, one physicist says that defects in spacetime explain both of these mysteries at the same time. In this episode of science news I have a look at this paper.\n\nThis video comes with a quiz which you can take here: https://quizwithit.com/start_thequiz/1748971420417x503138930832703500\n\nCorrection: I mixed up the gems, sorry.

          "Lars Gotrich | May 12, 2025\nBeth Gibbons' voice can cleave your heart in half and heal it back together. Whether fronting Portishead, singing Henryk Górecki's Symphony of Sorrowful Songs or guesting on a Kendrick Lamar track, Gibbons' frail, yet resilient timbre acts as reassurance that our aching world is worth loving and fighting for. To experience that voice is humbling; up close, it's breathtaking.\n\nThis set at the Tiny Desk is mostly culled from Lives Outgrown, her densely layered and lived-in album released last year. Sonically, Gibbons' solo debut feels worlds apart from the haunted electronic production of Portishead, yet her existential themes of loss, change and restless curiosity remain. There is, however, an invitation within these new songs to bear witness to Gibbons' own tragedy and transformation. In the daylight of the NPR Music office, she closes her eyes as she leans into the uncertainty of the moment, and turns away once a song ends.\n\nFor this performance, Gibbons and her seven-piece band opt to perform entirely acoustic, scaling down their sprawling stage show to emphasize the intimacy of these songs. In a way, these versions feel like homemade experiments knit together by trusted comrades — the arrangements still creak with awe and wonder, but the empyrean textures become more grounded. They close with \"Mysteries,\" the opening track from 2002's Out of Season, Gibbons' album-length collaboration with Rustin Man (aka Talk Talk's Paul Webb). \"Oh, mysteries of love where war is no more / I'll be there anytime,\" she sings. But when she turns away this time, Gibbons emits a surprisingly loud and piercing sound from deep within — a wordless warble that reflects all too well that she might have to wait for the turbulence to subside.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Tell Me Who You Are Today\"\n\"Floating on a Moment\"\n\"Lost Changes\"\n\"Mysteries\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBeth Gibbons: vocals\nEoin Rooney: guitar, background vocals\nJason Hazeley: piano\nRichard Jones: viola, guitar, background vocals\nTom Herbert: bass, background vocals\nEmma Smith: violin, background vocals\nHoward Jacobs: percussion, wind instruments, background vocals\nSophie Hastings: drums, background vocals \n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Lars Gotrich\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Tiffany Vera-Castro\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Alanté Serene\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #bethgibbons\n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

          "Here’s a pizza bake from start to finish in my @oonihq Koda 2 Pro pizza oven. This is the 7th or 8th Ooni I’ve owned (starting way back with the very first pellet-fired model), and it’s my favorite so far.\n\nIt’s gas (I’m running mine on a regular LP tank), which I frankly prefer to wood, coal, or pellets for these backyard ovens. Easier start up and maintain heat, which means I’m more likely to use it often. It’s also adjustable on the fly so you can preheat really hot and drop the flame down low when the pizza goes in if you prefer a style with a crisper bottom crust and more even golden brown color, like New York or a neo-Neapolitan.\n\nWhen it comes to pizza, wood doesn’t make any discernible difference in flavor anyway. A proper wood fire should be mostly smoke-free and the pizza is not in there long enough to pick up any discernible smoke flavor.\n\nThis oven is an upgrade from my previous fave pizza-focused oven, the Koda 16. At 18 inches it’s two inches wider, which gives plenty of room for maneuverability, larger pizzas, or dual personal pizzas. It has flame bars on both sides for more even heating, a glass heat shield so you can see the action, and a built-in ambient temp thermometer as well as a probe thermometer for keeping track of the temp of meat or other things you cook in it.\n\nI’m also a fan of the Karu series of ovens which are multi-fuel and have a taller ceiling so you can do things like roast a whole chicken or a tall loaf of bread.\n\n(IE the Koda is my choice for pizza fanatics and Karu for folks who want more versatility).\n\nYou can get the full recipe for the no-knead Neapolitan dough with a full length video for free on my Patreon. \n\n#ooni \n#sponsored \n#ad"

          "You can find an extended version of this interview on my Patreon page. No payment is necessary, just a free subscription. Here it is: https://www.patreon.com/posts/130861325/\n\nThis is a very special episode of my teriyaki series–my ongoing quest to visit every teriyaki shop in Seattle. You can find most of my teriyaki reviews/videos on my Instagram or my other YouTube profile, @JKenjiLopezMain.\n\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/kenjilopezalt/\n\n“It’s not a passion!” Toshi Kasahara insists, waving off the suggestion as I sit outside his Mill Creek teriyaki shop — the one where, at 76 years old, he still trims, marinates, and grills chicken thighs five nights a week. It’s just a business. For someone who has been grilling what’s arguably Seattle’s most iconic dish for nearly half a century, it’s a striking thing to hear.\n\nI recently had the chance to meet him — the man who pioneered chicken teriyaki as we know it — and to taste his version of it, made by his own hands."

The Chinese government recently completed a 10-kilometer borehole in the Tarim Basin, and has also launched a drillship that intends to drill into the Earth’s mantle through the seabed. If successful, it’d be the first to ever reach the mantle, after the Americans abandoned a similar project 50 years ago.

          "There are 100 knives available for purchase. Pre-orders for the Kenji x Vonhelmick are available immediately for Patreon subscribers (the subscription is 100% free) starting at noon Pacific today (5/25/2025).\n\nSubscribe and get order info here: https://www.patreon.com/c/kenjilopezalt\n\nAny unsold knives will go on sale to the general public on Wednesday, May 28th, 2025 at noon Pacific.\n\nFor me, a knife is more than just a tool. It’s my most valuable partner in the kitchen, the tool I reach for more than any other. Of course, it needs to function perfectly. It needs a hard, sharp edge that stays that way through all my prep. It needs finesse and precision for nimble cuts. It needs heft and balance to help me power through root vegetables or large meat cuts.\n\nBut the perfect knife needs to be more than that. It needs to be an object that I truly enjoy interacting with. An object that is as natural to hold as it is beautiful to behold. A knife that gives me a tingle of pleasure every time I reach for it. A knife whose character and utility will only grow with time.\n\nI am so proud to present this collaboration with bladesmith Gordon Hanson of Vonhelmick. We hope you love using this knife as much as we loved making it.\n\n\nSteel: 20-layer Carbon/Nickel Suminagashi Steel\n\nCore: Shiro2 Ultra High Carbon\n\nHandle Material: 200 Year Old American Black Walnut\n\nBlade Finish: Nashiji\n\nBlade Length: 170mm (6.6 inches)\n\nOverall Length: 295mm (11.6 inches)\n\nSpine Width: 2.4mm average\n\nWeight: 134g (average)\n\nGrind type: Flat\n\nWe hope you love your new knife as much as we loved making it.\n\nThe blade profile is informed by my decades of experience and designed to be precise, intuitive, functional, and balanced. The perfect blade for every day use.\n\nEach piece is individually hand-forged in Falls City, OR, using 20-layer suminagashi steel from Takefu Special Steels, featuring a Shiro2 ultra high carbon core—engineered for exceptional sharpness and precision. Hammered under a Sakamoto Shiki spring hammer, the steel is finished in the traditional nashiji style, which creates a lightly textured surface that keeps food from sticking to the face of the blade and gives each knife a unique appearance. The bevels are ground on a Kyowa Japanese water wheel, then acid-etched to reveal the layered suminagashi pattern. Each handle in this limited batch is hewn from stabilized black walnut, sourced from a 200-year-old tree in downtown McMinnville, Oregon, and accented with bands of Kenji’s signature colors: Guava Pink and Golden Yolk.\n\nEach knife is a singular creation—born of heritage, collaboration, and material integrity, as beautiful as it is functional."

Corenflos, which was me playing JT's song Swamp Stomp from his Somewhere Under The Radar album. The song in the montage and outro is called Blues & Dank Nugs, and I used my Bassman head into Tom's actual speaker cab on the leads and my copy of the JT half-open cab on the rhythms. For the rest of the background music I used my Line 6 HX Stomp pedal with the US Doulbe Vib amp model into my impulse response of Tom's guitar cab left speaker (1982 white label Celestion 65) for the Bukovac songs from Plexi Soul and my impulse response of one of JT's cabs for the JT song.\n\nFind Tom's channel at 501ChorusEcho and say hi to Uncle Larry."

I'm being totally honest when I say I'm just a performer, I don't know anything about circuits. This took me way outside my comfort zone, but I uncovered some truths that I find extremely interesting.\n\nThroughout the process I kept getting results that didn't match things I had read and heard not just from people on the internet, but from heroes of the industry. It made me realize that we're currently alive in the only time in all of human history where two things can be recorded, edited together, and played back to back, easily, at home. I'm not so sure that our heroes ever did that. I'm thankful that I have the opportunity to.\n\nThe way I look at guitar amps has been changed forever.\n\n-Jim, 10/3/22"

After testing a thousand different aspects of what makes guitar cabs sound like they do in my last video, I wanted to know what cab was used on my favorite music. It's a big piece of the sound.\n\nSo I went on a mission. It took years from start to finish, and involved an embarrassing amount of research, pulling up old files at my favorite studio, and a quick trip to the hardware store.\n\nHopefully I understand how to sound a little more like my electric guitar hero from here on out.\n\n-Jim, 9/6/22"

Hopefully people who watch this video will have a better idea of which things play a role in sustain, and how big that role is.\n\nAlso, I bought 2 of J.T.

His solo career took off in the late 1970s, and he became a global superstar in the 1980s with the release of Off the Wall (1979), Thriller (1982), and Bad (1987). Thriller remains the best-selling album of all time. Jackson was not only known for his powerful voice and genre-blending music, but also for his innovative music videos and signature dance moves, such as the moonwalk. He broke racial barriers on MTV, set new standards for pop performance, and influenced countless artists across generations. His humanitarian efforts and global reach earned him numerous awards and honors throughout his career."

          "FIXED VERSION: Sorry about the audio issues, this one should be all good!\nSupport 12tone on Patreon to see new videos early! https://www.patreon.com/12tonevideos\n\nThe early '80s were an exciting and scary time in the world of music. The first wave of truly affordable electronic instruments were just hitting the market, and pioneers from across the musical spectrum were trying to figure out what to do with them. These new machines were bulky and unreliable, but they offered powerful new ways to create and conceive of sound, and they turned out to be a lifeline for a struggling pair of artists who had just watched their musical dreams go up in flames. The remnants of the pop rock band The Tourists, Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart knew they had just one shot left, so they swung for the fences, and the result was Sweet Dreams.\n\nMerch: https://store.nebula.tv/12tone\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pq2QBEw\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/12tone.nebula.tv\nEmail: 12tonevideos@gmail.com\nWatch this video on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/12tone-understanding-sweet-dreams-are-made-of-this\n\nScript w/ sources: https://tinyurl.com/362chxee\n\nAnd thanks as well to Henry Reich, Jon Hancock, Eugene Bulkin, Adam Neely, Dave Mayer, OrionWolfie, CodenaCrow, Arnas, Caroline Simpson, Michael Alan Dorman, Blake Boyd, Charles Gaskell, Tom Evans, David Conrad, Ducky, Nikolay Semyonov, h2g2guy, Andrew Engel, Peter Brinkmann, naomio, Alex Mole, Betsy, Tonya Custis, Graeme Lewis, Jake Sand, Scott Albertine, Conor Stuart Roe, ZagOnEm, רועי סיני, Brian Miller, Thomas Morgan, Serena Crocker, Adam Ziegenhals, Mark, Amelia Lewis, Justin St John-Brooks, DialMForManning, Andrew Wyld, JD White, Graham Orndorff, gunnito, Kyle Kinkaid, Foreign Man in a Foreign Land, Tom, Andy Maurer, Don Jennings, Cormag81, Derek H., Bryan, Mikeyxote, Dan Whitmer, FAD3 Chaos, Michael Morris, Bill Owens, Martin Romano, George Burgyan, Flavor Dave, Marc Testart, DraconicDon, Megan Oberfield, morolin, An Oni Moose, Ken Birdwell, Blue 5alamander, Cliff Hudson, Ethan Savaglio, Robert Bailey, Donald Murray, juneau, Sina Bahram, Ira Kroll, Patrick Minton, Justin Katz, Roahn Wynar, Bob D'Errico, Robert Shaw, David Shlapak, JD, Rennie Allen, Travis Briggs, Greyson Erickson, Brian Covey, Jay Harris, Sean Murphy, JasperJackal, Tommy Transplant, Wolfgang Giersche, Olaf, Billy Abbott, Gil, d0d63, Jon Purdy, Ken Brown, Colin Kennedy, The Mauses, christopher porto, William Wallace, Karel P Kerezman, Ted Trainor, Antarct, mightstill, Nick Loh, Randy Thomson, Mikaela, Erika Lee, StephAgosta, Aenne Brielmann, Emma Finch, Klaus, Fefe Magalhaes, Andrew F.

As a longtime rock and metalhead, I've heard hundreds of songs trying to answer that question, and the thing that strikes me most is how varied those answers are. As an artist, the Devil is whoever you need him to be, a symbolic chameleon taking whatever shape best fits the song. He's one of our most ubiquitous folklore characters, as slippery as he is powerful, and to better understand him, Polyphonic and I are turning our attention to one of the most definitive depictions of the Devil in rock: Sympathy for the Devil, by the Rolling Stones.\n\nMerch: https://store.nebula.tv/12tone\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pq2QBEw\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/12tone.nebula.tv\nEmail: 12tonevideos@gmail.com\n\nScript w/ sources: https://tinyurl.com/2zurxdfb\n\nAnd thanks as well to Henry Reich, Jon Hancock, Eugene Bulkin, Adam Neely, Dave Mayer, OrionWolfie, CodenaCrow, Arnas, Caroline Simpson, Michael Alan Dorman, Blake Boyd, Charles Gaskell, Tom Evans, David Conrad, Ducky, Nikolay Semyonov, h2g2guy, Andrew Engel, Peter Brinkmann, naomio, Alex Mole, Betsy, Tonya Custis, Graeme Lewis, Jake Sand, Scott Albertine, Evan Satinsky, Conor Stuart Roe, ZagOnEm, רועי סיני, Brian Miller, Thomas Morgan, Serena Crocker, Adam Ziegenhals, Mark, Amelia Lewis, Justin St John-Brooks, DialMForManning, Andrew Wyld, JD White, Graham Orndorff, gunnito, Foreign Man in a Foreign Land, Kyle Kinkaid, Tom, Andy Maurer, Don Jennings, Cormag81, Derek H., Bryan, Mikeyxote, Dan Whitmer, FAD3 Chaos, Michael Morris, Bill Owens, Martin Romano, George Burgyan, Flavor Dave, Marc Testart, DraconicDon, Megan Oberfield, morolin, An Oni Moose, Ken Birdwell, Blue 5alamander, Cliff Hudson, Ethan Savaglio, Robert Bailey, Deirdre Saoirse Moen, Donald Murray, juneau, Sina Bahram, Ira Kroll, Patrick Minton, Justin Katz, Roahn Wynar, Chuck Dukhoff of The Stagger Lee Archives, Bob D'Errico, Robert Shaw, David Shlapak, JD, Rennie Allen, Travis Briggs, Greyson Erickson, Strife, Brian Covey, Jay Harris, Sean Murphy, JasperJackal, Tommy Transplant, Wolfgang Giersche, Olaf, Billy Abbott, Gil, d0d63, Jon Purdy, Ken Brown, Colin Kennedy, The Mauses, christopher porto, William Wallace, Karel P Kerezman, Ted Trainor, Antarct, mightstill, Nick Loh, Randy Thomson, Mikaela, Erika Lee, StephAgosta, Aenne Brielmann, Emma Finch, Klaus, Fefe Magalhaes, Andrew F.

It's true. I have a complicated relationship with Christmas music, and I've always been hesitant to bring that into my work, but there are a couple songs that really resonate with me, and the Carol of the Bells tops that list, so I figured after all this time, I should probably try talking about it. And then I started reading up on the history and... y'all. It's such an incredible story. I can't believe I didn't know where this song came from, and if you're anything like me, you won't believe it either.\n\nMerch: https://store.nebula.tv/12tone\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pq2QBEw\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/12tone.nebula.tv\nEmail: 12tonevideos@gmail.com\n\nScript w/ all sources: https://tinyurl.com/2w4782bw\n\nAnd thanks as well to Henry Reich, Jon Hancock, Eugene Bulkin, Oliver, Adam Neely, Dave Mayer, OrionWolfie, David Bartz, CodenaCrow, Arnas, Caroline Simpson, Michael Alan Dorman, Blake Boyd, Charles Gaskell, Tom Evans, David Conrad, Ducky, Nikolay Semyonov, Kenneth Kousen, h2g2guy, Andrew Engel, Peter Brinkmann, naomio, Alex Mole, Betsy, Tonya Custis, Graeme Lewis, Jake Sand, Scott Albertine, Evan Satinsky, Conor Stuart Roe, ZagOnEm, רועי סיני, Brian Miller, Thomas Morgan, Serena Crocker, Adam Ziegenhals, Mark, Amelia Lewis, Justin St John-Brooks, DialMForManning, Andrew Wyld, JD White, Graham Orndorff, gunnito, Foreign Man in a Foreign Land, Kyle Kinkaid, Tom, Andy Maurer, Don Jennings, Cormag81, Derek H., Bryan, Mikeyxote, Dan Whitmer, Thel 'Vadam, FAD3 Chaos, Michael Morris, Bill Owens, Martin Romano, George Burgyan, Matthew Soddy, Flavor Dave, Marc Testart, DraconicDon, Megan Oberfield, morolin, An Oni Moose, Ken Birdwell, Blue 5alamander, Cliff Hudson, JayneOfCanton, Ethan Savaglio, Robert Bailey, Deirdre Saoirse Moen, Donald Murray, juneau, Sina Bahram, Ira Kroll, Patrick Minton, Justin Katz, Roahn Wynar, Chuck Dukhoff of The Stagger Lee Archives, Bob D'Errico, Robert Shaw, David Shlapak, JD, Rennie Allen, Travis Briggs, Greyson Erickson, Jordan Nordstrom-Young, Strife, Brian Covey, Jay Harris, Sean Murphy, JasperJackal, Tommy Transplant, Wolfgang Giersche, Olaf, Colleen Chapman, Billy Abbott, Gil, d0d63, Jon Purdy, Ken Brown, Colin Kennedy, The Mauses, christopher porto, William Wallace, Karel P Kerezman, Ted Trainor, rpenguinboy, Antarct, mightstill, Nick Loh, Randy Thomson, Mikaela, Erika Lee, Aenne Brielmann, Emma Finch, Eric Berg, Klaus, Fefe Magalhaes, Andrew F.

Sorry about that.\nSupport 12tone on Patreon to help us keep making cool videos! https://www.patreon.com/12tonevideos\nWatch this video on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/12tone-understanding-green-days-holiday\n\nI've been thinking a lot recently about the presidency of George W. Bush. His two terms coincide almost perfectly with my teenage years, and watching how he led the country had a huge impact on my relationship with politics. These days, he's mostly rebranded himself as just a goofy little man who loves to paint, but that's not the Bush I remember. The Bush of my teenage years was worse, more dangerous, and while it's been a long time since he had that sort of power, the damage he did in those 8 years is still leaving scars today. So, to help me process these feelings, I'm turning to the art I grew up with, the never-ending sea of anti-Bush protest songs, and picking out one of my absolute favorites: Green Day's Holiday.\n\nDonation links: \nNational Network of Abortion Funds: https://abortionfunds.org/donate/\nNational Bail Fund Network: https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/en/nbfn-directory\nFood Not Bombs: https://foodnotbombs.net/new_site/donate.php\nNational Immigration Project: https://secure.nipnlg.org/forms/donate\n\n\nMerch: https://store.nebula.tv/12tone\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pq2QBEw\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/12tone.nebula.tv\nEmail: 12tonevideos@gmail.com\n\nScript: https://tinyurl.com/mvnuhevw\n\nAnd thanks as well to Henry Reich, Jon Hancock, Eugene Bulkin, Oliver, Adam Neely, Dave Mayer, OrionWolfie, David Bartz, CodenaCrow, Arnas, Caroline Simpson, Michael Alan Dorman, Blake Boyd, Charles Gaskell, Tom Evans, David Conrad, Ducky, Nikolay Semyonov, Kenneth Kousen, h2g2guy, Andrew Engel, Peter Brinkmann, naomio, Alex Mole, Betsy, Tonya Custis, Graeme Lewis, Jake Sand, Scott Albertine, Evan Satinsky, Conor Stuart Roe, ZagOnEm, רועי סיני, Brian Miller, Thomas Morgan, Serena Crocker, Adam Ziegenhals, Mark, Amelia Lewis, Justin St John-Brooks, DialMForManning, Andrew Wyld, JD White, Graham Orndorff, gunnito, Foreign Man in a Foreign Land, Kyle Kinkaid, Tom, William Christie, Andy Maurer, Don Jennings, Cormag81, Derek H., Bryan, Mikeyxote, Dan Whitmer, Thel 'Vadam, FAD3 Chaos, Bill Owens, Martin Romano, George Burgyan, Matthew Soddy, Flavor Dave, Marc Testart, DraconicDon, Megan Oberfield, morolin, An Oni Moose, Ken Birdwell, Blue 5alamander, Cliff Hudson, JayneOfCanton, Ethan Savaglio, Robert Bailey, Deirdre Saoirse Moen, Donald Murray, juneau, Sina Bahram, Ira Kroll, Patrick Minton, Justin Katz, Roahn Wynar, Chuck Dukhoff of The Stagger Lee Archives, Bob D'Errico, Robert Shaw, David Shlapak, JD, Rennie Allen, Travis Briggs, Claire Postlethwaite, Greyson Erickson, Jordan Nordstrom-Young, Strife, Brian Covey, Jay Harris, Sean Murphy, JasperJackal, Tommy Transplant, Wolfgang Giersche, Olaf, Colleen Chapman, Billy Abbott, Gil, d0d63, Jon Purdy, Ken Brown, Colin Kennedy, The Mauses, christopher porto, William Wallace, Karel P Kerezman, Ted Trainor, rpenguinboy, Antarct, mightstill, Nick Loh, Randy Thomson, Mikaela, Erika Lee, Aenne Brielmann, Emma Finch, Eric Berg, Klaus, Fefe Magalhaes, and Andrew F.

It's a question explored by many great works of art across the years, but in this current moment, one of the most thoughtful takes on the question must be Harry Chapin's classic ballad, Cat's In The Cradle. Written alongside his wife Sandy, and inspired by her past experiences with her ex-husband, the song carefully balances the desire for love with a lack of communication that makes building that deeper connection impossible, as a tragic warning to prospective fathers everywhere.\n\nMerch: https://store.nebula.tv/12tone\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pq2QBEw\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/12tone.nebula.tv\nEmail: 12tonevideos@gmail.com\n\nScript: https://tinyurl.com/nh9wfbcs\n\nAnd thanks as well to Henry Reich, Jon Hancock, Eugene Bulkin, Oliver, Adam Neely, Dave Mayer, OrionWolfie, David Bartz, CodenaCrow, Arnas, Caroline Simpson, Michael Alan Dorman, Blake Boyd, Charles Gaskell, Tom Evans, David Conrad, Ducky, Nikolay Semyonov, Kenneth Kousen, h2g2guy, Andrew Engel, Peter Brinkmann, naomio, Alex Mole, Betsy, Tonya Custis, Walther, Graeme Lewis, Jake Sand, Scott Albertine, Evan Satinsky, Conor Stuart Roe, ZagOnEm, רועי סיני, Brian Miller, Thomas Morgan, Serena Crocker, Adam Ziegenhals, Mark, Amelia Lewis, Justin St John-Brooks, DialMForManning, Andrew Wyld, JD White, Graham Orndorff, gunnito, Foreign Man in a Foreign Land, Kyle Kinkaid, Tom, William Christie, Joyce Orndorff, Andy Maurer, Don Jennings, Cormag81, Derek H., Bryan, Mikeyxote, Dan Whitmer, Thel 'Vadam, FAD3 Chaos, Michael Morris, Bill Owens, Martin Romano, George Burgyan, Marc Testart, Alin Nica, Matthew Soddy, Flavor Dave, DraconicDon, Megan Oberfield, morolin, An Oni Moose, Ken Birdwell, Blue 5alamander, Cliff Hudson, JayneOfCanton, Ethan Savaglio, Robert Bailey, Deirdre Saoirse Moen, Donald Murray, juneau, Sina Bahram, Ira Kroll, Patrick Minton, Justin Katz, Roahn Wynar, Chuck Dukhoff of The Stagger Lee Archives, Bob D'Errico, Robert Shaw, David Shlapak, JD, Rennie Allen, Travis Briggs, Claire Postlethwaite, Greyson Erickson, Matt Deeds, Jordan Nordstrom-Young, Brian Covey, Miles_Naismith, Jay Harris, Sean Murphy, JasperJackal, Tommy Transplant, Wolfgang Giersche, Olaf, Colleen Chapman, Gil, d0d63, Jon Purdy, Ken Brown, Colin Kennedy, The Mauses, christopher porto, Billy Abbott, William Wallace, Karel P Kerezman, Ted Trainor, rpenguinboy, mightstill, Nick Loh, Randy Thomson, Antarct, Mikaela, Erika Lee, Vinayak Nagaraj, Aenne Brielmann, Emma Finch, Eric Berg, Klaus, Fefe Magalhaes!

Many great pieces of music have been dragged down by poorly executed lyrics, and while there are, of course, many factors to a great lyric, there's one often-overlooked aspect that regularly causes unprepared songwriters to lose control: The shapes of the words themselves. It sounds simple, and honestly it kind of is, but trust me, really understanding those subtle nuances of sound is an absolute game-changer, and once you know how to think about it, it's one of the easiest ways to make your lyrics better.\n\nMerch: https://store.nebula.tv/12tone\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pq2QBEw\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/12tone.nebula.tv\nEmail: 12tonevideos@gmail.com\n\nScript: https://tinyurl.com/bddtc65x\n\nAnd thanks as well to Henry Reich, Jon Hancock, Gene Lushtak, Eugene Bulkin, Oliver, Adam Neely, Dave Mayer, OrionWolfie, David Bartz, CodenaCrow, Arnas, Caroline Simpson, Michael Alan Dorman, Blake Boyd, Charles Gaskell, Tom Evans, David Conrad, Ducky, Nikolay Semyonov, Kenneth Kousen, h2g2guy, Andrew Engel, Peter Brinkmann, naomio, Alex Mole, Betsy, Tonya Custis, Walther, Graeme Lewis, Jake Sand, Jim Hayes, Scott Albertine, Evan Satinsky, Conor Stuart Roe, ZagOnEm, רועי סיני, Brian Miller, Thomas Morgan, Serena Crocker, Adam Ziegenhals, Mark, Amelia Lewis, Justin St John-Brooks, DialMForManning, Andrew Wyld, JD White, Graham Orndorff, gunnito, Foreign Man in a Foreign Land, Kyle Kinkaid, Tom, William Christie, Joyce Orndorff, Isaac Hampton, Mark Mitchell Gloster, Andy Maurer, William Spratley, Don Jennings, Cormag81, Derek Hiemforth, Bryan, Mikeyxote, Milan Durnell, Dan Whitmer, Thel 'Vadam, FAD3 Chaos, Michael Morris, Bill Owens, Martin Romano, George Burgyan, Marc Testart, Carlfish, Matthew Soddy, Flavor Dave, Alin Nica, DraconicDon, Megan Oberfield, morolin, An Oni Moose, Ken Birdwell, Blue 5alamander, Cliff Hudson, JayneOfCanton, Ethan Savaglio, Robert Bailey, Deirdre Saoirse Moen, juneau, Sina Bahram, Ira Kroll, Patrick Minton, Justin Katz, Roahn Wynar, Chuck Dukhoff of The Stagger Lee Archives, Bob D'Errico, Robert Shaw, Donald Murray, David Shlapak, JD, Rennie Allen, Travis Briggs, Claire Postlethwaite, Greyson Erickson, Matt Deeds, Jordan Nordstrom-Young, Strife, Brian Covey, Miles_Naismith, Jay Harris, Sean Murphy, JasperJackal, Tommy Transplant, Wolfgang Giersche, Olaf, Colleen Chapman, ParzivaLore, Gil, d0d63, Jon Purdy, Ken Brown, Colin Kennedy, The Mauses, christopher porto, Billy Abbott, William Wallace, Karel P Kerezman, Ted Trainor, mightstill, Nick Loh, Randy Thomson, rpenguinboy, Antarct, Mikaela, Erika Lee, Vinayak Nagaraj, sandra zarbatany, Aenne Brielmann, Emma Finch, Eric Berg, Michael Dmytriw, Brian Gregory, Klaus, and robert johnston!

There are optimistic, almost evangelical readings, but there are also dark, frightening stories of predators lurking inside: To see that duality, one need look no further than the covers by Johnny Cash and Marilyn Manson. But while each of those stakes out its claim, the original leaves things much more ambiguous, as Depeche Mode invites you to reflect on your own relationship to the concepts of divinity, salvation, and exploitation.

After cutting their teeth in the '90s britpop scene and crossing over to the US with familiar alt rock sounds, they decided to take things in a slightly... different direction. Since the late '90s, Radiohead has refused to retread musical ground, constantly pushing themselves to explore surprising sounds and experiment with new compositional techniques. No two Radiohead albums are alike, and yet through all that variety they've remained surprisingly recognizable. There's something that makes their work sound inherently Radiohead, and I want to know what.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/12tonevideos\nMerch: https://store.nebula.tv/12tone\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pq2QBEw\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/12tone.nebula.tv\nEmail: 12tonevideos@gmail.com\n\nScript: https://tinyurl.com/57c42xke\nDavid Bennet video: https://youtu.be/CEi9ecBRR_4\nHolistic Songwriting's video: https://youtu.be/alt9sQepob4\nDr. Osborn's book: https://books.google.com/books/about/Everything_in_Its_Right_Place.html?id=mgsBDQAAQBAJ\n\nAnd thanks as well to Henry Reich, Jon Hancock, Gene Lushtak, Eugene Bulkin, Oliver, Adam Neely, Dave Mayer, OrionWolfie, David Bartz, CodenaCrow, Arnas, Caroline Simpson, Michael Alan Dorman, Blake Boyd, Charles Gaskell, Tom Evans, David Conrad, Ducky, Nikolay Semyonov, Chris Connett, Kenneth Kousen, h2g2guy, Andrew Engel, Peter Brinkmann, naomio, Alex Mole, Betsy, Tonya Custis, Walther, Graeme Lewis, Jake Sand, Jim Hayes, Scott Albertine, Evan Satinsky, Conor Stuart Roe, ZagOnEm, רועי סיני, Brian Miller, Thomas Morgan, Serena Crocker, Adam Ziegenhals, Mark, Amelia Lewis, Justin St John-Brooks, DialMForManning, Andrew Wyld, JD White, Graham Orndorff, gunnito, Foreign Man in a Foreign Land, Tom, Kyle Kinkaid, William Christie, Joyce Orndorff, Isaac Hampton, Mark Mitchell Gloster, Andy Maurer, William Spratley, Don Jennings, Cormag81, Derek Hiemforth, Bryan, Mikeyxote, Milan Durnell, Dan Whitmer, Thel 'Vadam, FAD3 Chaos, Michael Morris, Bill Owens, Martin Romano, George Burgyan, Marc Testart, Carlfish, Matthew Soddy, Flavor Dave, Alin Nica, DraconicDon, Megan Oberfield, morolin, An Oni Moose, Ken Birdwell, Blue 5alamander, Cliff Hudson, Olivia Herald, JayneOfCanton, Ethan Savaglio, Robert Bailey, Deirdre Saoirse Moen, juneau, Sina Bahram, Ira Kroll, Patrick Minton, Justin Katz, Roahn Wynar, Chuck Dukhoff of The Stagger Lee Archives, Bob D'Errico, Robert Shaw, David Shlapak, Donald Murray, JD, Rennie Allen, Travis Briggs, Claire Postlethwaite, Greyson Erickson, Matt Deeds, Jordan Nordstrom-Young, Strife, Brian Covey, Miles_Naismith, Jay Harris, Sean Murphy, JasperJackal, Tommy Transplant, Wolfgang Giersche, ParzivaLore, Amanda Jones, Olaf, Colleen Chapman, Gil, d0d63, Jon Purdy, Ken Brown, Colin Kennedy, The Mauses, christopher porto, Billy Abbott, William Wallace, Karel P Kerezman, Ted Trainor, mightstill, Nick Loh, Randy Thomson, rpenguinboy, Antarct, Erika Lee, Mikaela, Vinayak Nagaraj, sandra zarbatany, Aenne Brielmann, Emma Finch, Eric Berg, and Michael Dmytriw!

That was the conundrum faced by Pink Floyd after the release of Dark Side Of The Moon, and while each member had their own response, the overall answer seemed to be \"mourn the loss of a purpose\". They'd done it, and they weren't happy, so the band, led by their famously cantankerous bassist Roger Waters, decided to look inward. They didn't like what they saw, but as artists, they knew how to handle that sort of darkness: You turn it into more art. Wish You Were Here wasn't a passion project, it was a project of necessity, ground out of the band by a music industry that demanded a follow-up to keep the money flowing, and at the heart of the album, Waters struck back, laying bare all his sharpest critiques of the business that had destroyed his soul.\n\n\nMerch: https://store.nebula.tv/12tone\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pq2QBEw\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/12tone.nebula.tv\nEmail: 12tonevideos@gmail.com\n\nScript: https://tinyurl.com/2s48snpb\n\nAnd thanks as well to Henry Reich, Jon Hancock, Gene Lushtak, Eugene Bulkin, Oliver, Adam Neely, Dave Mayer, OrionWolfie, David Bartz, CodenaCrow, Arnas, Caroline Simpson, Michael Alan Dorman, Blake Boyd, Charles Gaskell, Tom Evans, David Conrad, Ducky, Nikolay Semyonov, Chris Connett, Kenneth Kousen, h2g2guy, Andrew Engel, Peter Brinkmann, naomio, Alex Mole, Betsy, Tonya Custis, Walther, Graeme Lewis, Jake Sand, Jim Hayes, Scott Albertine, Evan Satinsky, Conor Stuart Roe, ZagOnEm, רועי סיני, Brian Miller, Thomas Morgan, Serena Crocker, Adam Ziegenhals, Mark, Amelia Lewis, Justin St John-Brooks, DialMForManning, Andrew Wyld, JD White, Graham Orndorff, gunnito, Douglas Anderson, Foreign Man in a Foreign Land, Tom, Kyle Kinkaid, William Christie, Joyce Orndorff, Isaac Hampton, Mark Mitchell Gloster, Andy Maurer, William Spratley, Don Jennings, Cormag81, Derek Hiemforth, Bryan, Mikeyxote, Milan Durnell, Dan Whitmer, Thel 'Vadam, FAD3 Chaos, Michael Morris, Bill Owens, Martin Romano, George Burgyan, Marc Testart, Carlfish, Matthew Soddy, Flavor Dave, Alin Nica, DraconicDon, John W Campbell, Megan Oberfield, morolin, An Oni Moose, Ken Birdwell, Blue 5alamander, Cliff Hudson, Olivia Herald, JayneOfCanton, or dahan, Ethan Savaglio, Robert Bailey, Deirdre Saoirse Moen, juneau, Sina Bahram, Ira Kroll, Patrick Minton, Justin Katz, Roahn Wynar, Chuck Dukhoff of The Stagger Lee Archives, Bob D'Errico, Robert Shaw, David Shlapak, Donald Murray, JD, Rennie Allen, Travis Briggs, Claire Postlethwaite, Greyson Erickson, Matt Deeds, Jordan Nordstrom-Young, Strife, Brian Covey, Miles_Naismith, Jay Harris, Sean Murphy, JasperJackal, Tommy Transplant, Wolfgang Giersche, Autographedcat, ParzivaLore, Amanda Jones, Olaf, Colleen Chapman, Gil, d0d63, Jon Purdy, Ken Brown, Colin Kennedy, The Mauses, Tom Belknap, christopher porto, Katherine Drevis, Billy Abbott, William Wallace, Karel P Kerezman, Ted Trainor, mightstill, Nick Loh, Randy Thomson, rpenguinboy, Antarct, Erika Lee, Mikaela, Vinayak Nagaraj, sandra zarbatany, and Aenne Brielmann!

          "The most overlooked instrument needs love too.\nGet 40% off an annual plan with Nebula: https://go.nebula.tv/12tone\nOr just go watch the full version of this video: https://nebula.tv/videos/12tone-write-better-drum-parts\n\nDrums are the hardest instrument to write for. Or, rather, they're the easiest, and that's the problem. For arrangers without a lot of percussion experience, it's natural to just default to a simple pattern and leave it alone, or to try to overcomplicate things without understanding their purpose, and either way, the end result is often a pretty lackluster beat. But I'm also an arranger without a lot of percussion experience, and over the years I've had to learn a lot of drum lessons the hard way, so for all my fellow non-drummers, I thought I'd put together a little guide on how I approach the rock ensemble's most challenging instrument.\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/12tonevideos\nMerch: https://store.nebula.tv/12tone\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/pq2QBEw\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/12tone.nebula.tv\nEmail: 12tonevideos@gmail.com\n\nScript: https://tinyurl.com/7adbjn6c\n8-Bit's video: https://youtu.be/FoMmVlAvjmM\nDr. Geary's paper: https://mtosmt.org/issues/mto.24.30.2/mto.24.30.2.geary.html\n\nAnd thanks as well to Henry Reich, Jon Hancock, Gene Lushtak, Eugene Bulkin, Oliver, Adam Neely, Dave Mayer, OrionWolfie, David Bartz, CodenaCrow, Arnas, Caroline Simpson, Michael Alan Dorman, Blake Boyd, Charles Gaskell, Tom Evans, David Conrad, Ducky, Nikolay Semyonov, Chris Connett, Kenneth Kousen, h2g2guy, Andrew Engel, Peter Brinkmann, naomio, Alex Mole, Betsy, Tonya Custis, Walther, Graeme Lewis, Jake Sand, Jim Hayes, Scott Albertine, Evan Satinsky, Conor Stuart Roe, ZagOnEm, רועי סיני, Brian Miller, Thomas Morgan, Serena Crocker, Adam Ziegenhals, Mark, Amelia Lewis, Justin St John-Brooks, DialMForManning, Andrew Wyld, JD White, Graham Orndorff, gunnito, Foreign Man in a Foreign Land, Tom, Kyle Kinkaid, William Christie, Joyce Orndorff, Isaac Hampton, Mark Mitchell Gloster, Andy Maurer, William Spratley, Don Jennings, Cormag81, Derek Hiemforth, Bryan, Mikeyxote, Milan Durnell, Dan Whitmer, Thel 'Vadam, FAD3 Chaos, Michael Morris, Bill Owens, Martin Romano, George Burgyan, Marc Testart, Carlfish, Matthew Soddy, Flavor Dave, Alin Nica, DraconicDon, Megan Oberfield, morolin, An Oni Moose, Ken Birdwell, Blue 5alamander, Cliff Hudson, Olivia Herald, JayneOfCanton, Ethan Savaglio, Robert Bailey, Deirdre Saoirse Moen, juneau, Sina Bahram, Ira Kroll, Patrick Minton, Justin Katz, Roahn Wynar, Chuck Dukhoff of The Stagger Lee Archives, Bob D'Errico, Robert Shaw, David Shlapak, Donald Murray, JD, Rennie Allen, Travis Briggs, Claire Postlethwaite, Greyson Erickson, Matt Deeds, Jordan Nordstrom-Young, Strife, Brian Covey, Miles_Naismith, Jay Harris, Sean Murphy, JasperJackal, Tommy Transplant, Wolfgang Giersche, ParzivaLore, Amanda Jones, Olaf, Colleen Chapman, Gil, d0d63, Jon Purdy, Ken Brown, Colin Kennedy, The Mauses, christopher porto, Billy Abbott, William Wallace, Karel P Kerezman, Ted Trainor, mightstill, Nick Loh, Randy Thomson, rpenguinboy, Antarct, Erika Lee, Mikaela, Vinayak Nagaraj, sandra zarbatany, Aenne Brielmann, Emma Finch, Eric Berg, and Michael Dmytriw!

          "This Black Music Month, Tiny Desk honors the anniversaries of landmark albums that have shaped the course of music and culture.\n\nBobby Carter | June 2, 2025\nBay Area ambassador E-40 moves with the energy of an up-and-coming emcee, but he's been around a minute. To put it 40 Water's way: \"I've been doing this since Kermit the Frog was a pollywog!\" Our biggest hurdle to clear was packing in three decades of music at the Tiny Desk, but 40 Fonzarelli and his band clocked weeks of rehearsal to make sure this office was rockin'.\n\nE-40's sophomore solo album In a Major Way dropped in 1995, one of the most competitive years in hip-hop history, with certified classics dropping weekly by the likes of 2Pac, Mobb Deep, Goodie Mob, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Raekwon and GZA. Straightforward and plain has never been E-40's nature, and that left-of-center spit has been the thing that has sustained his illustrious entertainment career.\n\nAt the Desk, Charlie Hustle sets things off with \"Da Bumble\" from In a Major Way and continues to bounce through a catalog of big hits sprinkled with nods to his day ones. Producer Lil Jon brought him back to the mainstream in the early 2000s with \"Tell Me When to Go,\" \"U and Dat\" and \"Snap Yo Fingers,\" while TikTok injected new life in \"Choices (Yup)\" and introduced him to Gen Z. \"I'm on my fourth wind!\" 40 tells us. No lies told.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Da Bumble\"\n\"Yay Area\" \n\"Sprinkle Me\"\n\"Captain Save a Hoe\"\n\"Snap Yo Fingers\"\n\"U and Dat\" \n\"Choices (Yup)\"\n\"Hope I Don't Go Back\"\n\"1-Luv\" \n\"Function\"\n\"Tell Me When to Go\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nE-40: vocals\nKev Choice: music director, keys\nBosko Kante: music director, background vocals\nMartin Luther: guitar, background vocals\nHoward Wiley: saxophone, EWI\nMarcus Phillips: bass, keys\nDame Drummer: drums, background vocals\nSilk-E The People's Champ aka Sherri Stack-A-Grip: background vocals\nDJ KMP: DJ, background vocals\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor:  Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Maia Stern, Kara Frame, Mitra I.

          "Felix Contreras | May 27, 2025\nBased on real-life events and people, Buena Vista Social Club features many characters and lots of great Cuban music. It takes such skill to reflect music of a bygone era, even more to sound fresh and vibrant night after night for months at a time. Scaled down for the Tiny Desk, the show is no less magical.\n\nBefore it was a Broadway musical racking up Tony Award nominations, the Buena Vista Social Club was a second chance. After the Cuban Revolution, many of the country's beloved musicians were lost to time, but in 1996, an ensemble was formed to reclaim their spotlight. To tell their story, the musical goes back and forth between the 1940s and the recording sessions that produced a masterpiece.\n\nAfter the band warms up the Tiny Desk crowd with \"El Cuarto de Tula,\" we meet young versions of the central characters: Compay Segundo (Da'Von Moody), Ibrahim Ferrer (Wesley Wray) and Omara Portuondo (Isa Antonetti) — their harmonies shine together on \"La Negra Tomasa.\" Antonetti takes on the bolero-son standard \"Lágrimas Negras.\" We also meet the older version of Ferrer, played by Mel Semé, for \"Candela.\" Marco Ramirez, who wrote the book for Buena Vista Social Club, is our emcee for this performance, guiding us through the story.\n\nThe secret sauce is, of course, the music. These are the foundational building blocks of what has made Cuban music so popular before and after the revolution in 1959. Some of the best musicians in NYC who have experience with classic Cuban music are in this production. Buena Vista Social Club is a living, breathing and deeply grooving homage to the era, the music and the island.\n\nSET LIST\n\"El Cuarto de Tula\"\n\"La Negra Tomasa\"\n\"Lágrimas Negras\"\n\"Candela\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nWesley Wray: vocals\nDa'Von Moody: vocals\nIsa Antonetti: vocals\nMel Semé: vocals\nMarco Paguia: music director, piano, güiro\nRenesito Avich: tres, vocals \nDavid Oquendo: guitar, vocals \nLeonardo Reyna: piano\nMaxilmilien Darché: trumpet, flugelhorn \nHery Paz: flute, clarinet, background vocals\nEddie \"Arnoldito\" Venegas: trombone, background vocals\nGustavo \"Chacho\" Schartz: bass, background vocals\nRomán Diaz: bongos, cowbell\nJavier Díaz: congas\nMarco Ramirez: emcee\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Felix Contreras\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josephine Nyounai\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistant: Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Zayrha Rodriguez\nTiny Desk Team: Josh Newell, Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#buenavistasocialclub #nprmusic #tinydesk \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

Those columns help prevent buckling of the diagonal and the weight of people on the floor above, but do not take the majority of the gravity load. So we left them out of our diagram to clearly explain the load paths.

The Traktorino is an open-source DIY MIDI controller for DJs. The first version, released in 2018, gained a lot of attention, and many of you asked for an update—so I built a new version that’s better and easier to assemble. This is the very first prototype!\n\nI built it using an Arduino Pro Micro, potentiometers, mechanical switches, slide potentiometers, and a rotary encoder.

          "Felix Contreras | May 16, 2025\nCarín León is an old soul. There is no other way to account for the power of the emotion in his voice. His 16-piece band tests the limited space behind the Tiny Desk, but when the brass takes over to punctuate a performance, Leon's commanding presence shows why he's one of the best at what he does.\n\nRegional Mexican music is based upon song forms from another era, but León's lyrics add a new spin on heartbreak and love lost. This set opens with \"Ese Vato No Te Queda,\" followed by two songs from the 2024 album Palabra De To's. Previously, León premiered \"Primera Cita\" for his Tiny Desk (home) concert, which became a major hit. That song \"left a mark on our lives and completely shaped our careers,\" he shares. For good luck, León here premieres \"Por la Suave,\" which was also written by Alejandro Lozano. \"A poem that I love,\" León says.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Ese Vato No Te Queda\"\n\"Lado Frágil\"\n\"El Amor de Mi Herida\"\n\"Por la Suave\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCarín León: vocals\nArturo Garcia: guitar \nLuis Diaz de Leon Huez: guitar\nMiguel Abraham Nayares Moreno: 12-string guitar\nAlan Ortega: dobro \nJavier Humberto Sesma Rivera: tololoche\nDaniel Fuentevilla: keys\nServando Quijada: alto horn\nMarcos Barbosa: alto horn\nSebastián Quintero: saxophone, harmonica, clarinet \nJhonatan Velázquez Villegas: clarinet\nJosé Angel Avila Llunez: trumpet\nIsmael Mendoza: trumpet\nCarlos Leon: trombone\nAbel Anguiano: trombone\nAntonio Zepeda: tuba\nLuis Carlos Pérez: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Alanté Serene\nAudio Engineer: Hannah Gluvna\nProduction Assistants: Dora Levite, Ashley Pointer\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #carinleon \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

          "Lars Gotrich | May 7, 2025\nMusic can transport you, even or especially when the destination's unknown. For 22 minutes, this is what Jeff Parker's Tiny Desk with the ETA IVtet can offer: a space for your mind to meditate on what the music speaks, set to a gossamer groove.\n\nEven though Parker is in the group's name, equality runs the show: a quiet drone sets the tone, then the music is completely improvised. Stillness, followed by reflection and response. Josh Johnson, an alto saxophonist with a quiet-yet-commanding sense of effects, builds little worlds out of loops and fluttering melody. Jay Bellerose, a drummer who's worked with the likes of Allen Toussaint and Suzanne Vega, is painterly in his brush and stick work, but bursts with a sun-beamed drum fill when the moment calls. Anna Butterss performed next to Jenny Lewis for her Tiny Desk in early 2020; here, the bassist both provides a grounding presence and the basis for liftoff. Parker — an immediately recognizable, yet malleable guitarist known for his time in Tortoise, the Chicago Underground and a CV far too long to list here — plays with repetition until melodic figures reveal themselves. Informed by the members' backgrounds in jazz, ambient, funk, rock, electronic and minimalist music, the band's mystical approach to improvisation never bends to one sound at a time.\n\nAndie Huether, our audio technical director for this concert, dug into NPR's equipment archives and set out a Nagra IV tape recorder on the Desk as a nod to engineer Bryce Gonzales, who developed a live mixing and recording rig with a similar unit for the band's sets at the now-closed ETA club in Los Angeles. \"In the days before portable digital recorders,\" Huether explains, \"NPR reporters and engineers would take machines like this one into the field to capture reporting and bring (or ship) the resultant tapes back to HQ to be edited and incorporated into our broadcasts.\" We didn't record this Tiny Desk analog, but the spirit remains: a conversation captured in small space, one worth watching — and hearing — over and over again.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Hearing 3.26.25\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJeff Parker: guitar\nJosh Johnson: alto saxophone\nAnna Butterss: bass\nJay Bellerose: drums\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Lars Gotrich\nDirector/Editor: Maia Stern\nAudio Technical Director: Andie Huether\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame\nAudio Engineer: Josh Newell\nProduction Assistants: Ashley Pointer, Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Grace Raver\nTiny Desk Copy Editor: Hazel Cills \nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#jeffparker #nprmusic #tinydesk \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

          "Mitra I. Arthur | May 5, 2025\nAs a director, Jamie Lloyd applies a minimalist approach to theater. His revival of SUNSET BLVD. is the perfect match for the sometimes challenging directive of Tiny Desk — to distill the essence of the music. All artifice is stripped down to showcase the tragedy of the characters and the grandeur of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music and lyrics by Don Black and Christopher Hampton. In this tale of tarnished Hollywood, Nicole Scherzinger and Tom Francis make their Tony Award-nominated Broadway debuts as Norma Desmond, faded star of the silent screen, and failing screenwriter Joe Gillis.\n\nFor this production, the show serves up a dazzling pair of Tiny Desk versions in conversation with arrangements familiar to fans. The eight-member orchestra, led by music director Alan Williams, delivers lush instrumentals throughout. Scherzinger and Francis' duet of \"The Perfect Year\" is reenvisioned as a soft rocker with R&B vibes. \"Sunset Boulevard\" rocks, which perfectly suits Francis' voice; here, he stands still, rather than his usual stroll through New York City streets. In both arrangements, Justin Rothberg's electric guitar shines. To bookend this performance, Scherzinger's expansive voice commands the stage in \"With One Look\" and in a blistering rendition of \"As If We Never Said Goodbye.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"With One Look\" \n\"The Perfect Year\"\n\"Sunset Boulevard\"\n\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNicole Scherzinger: vocals\nTom Francis: vocals, guitar\nAlan Williams: keys, music director\nJustin Rothberg: guitar\nPete Donovan: bass\nJoe Nero: drums\nAnnaliesa Place: violin\nPhilip Payton: violin\nTodd Low: viola\nSarah Hewitt-Roth: cello\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Mitra I.

          "Anamaria Sayre | May 1, 2025\nThere’s no falsifying the kind of joy PJ Sin Suela exudes — its infectiousness, magnetic and consistent. From San Juan to the Tiny Desk, it’s hard to catch a moment where the Puerto Rican rapper, doctor and author doesn’t smile, laugh or perreo hasta abajo. This performance, the perfect space for the world to see a true PJ, is no exception.\n\nOn songs like “TOP” and “Amor Artificial,” he waxes about love in buoyant and silly ways — “por ti, Darwin estudio la evolución (for you, Darwin studied evolution),” goes one line. But like many Puerto Rican artists in love with their island home, PJ’s sonic landscape features mountains of lightness built on a past and present pain. “Mambrú,” which closes out this set, tells the story of a young Puerto Rican man who joins the U.S. Army, ships off to fight “under a flag that doesn’t fill him up” and doesn’t return home the same.\n\nThe key, for PJ Sin Suela, is to keep home close. At the Tiny Desk, Puerto Rican flags wave proudly and there are protest stickers everywhere that highlight issues near and dear to his heart. There’s no inch of PJ Sin Suela or his art that isn’t focused on the needs of his people. But the island’s challenges, in his world, go hand in hand with hometown pride, summed up on “Duolingo”: “Everybody be like, ‘Damn boy, where you from? Illinois?’ / No bitch, Puerto Rico de donde salen tus artistas favoritos (where all your favorite artists come from).”\n\nSET LIST\n“Tengo Una Nota”\n“Duolingo”\n“Mírame”\n“Amor Artificial”\n“TOP”\n“Mambrú”\n\nMUSICIANS\nPJ Sin Suela: vocals\nKalani Trinidad: flute, keys, talk box\nBarba Blanca: keys\nJahaziel Garcia: trumpet \nJanice Maisonet: tenor saxophone\nBenson Pagán: guitar\nMessy Deprat: bass\nDavid B.: drums \nGabo Lugo: percussion \nRafita: hypeman\nYeidimar Ramos: background vocals \nUniversónica: background vocals\nAlexssa Hernández: sign language interpreter\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Anamaria Sayre\nDirector/Editor: Kara Frame\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nHost/Series Producer: Bobby Carter\nVideographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Joshua Bryant, Zayrha Rodriguez\nAudio Engineer: Neil Tevault\nProduction Assistants: Ashley Pointer, Dora Levite\nPhotographer: Alanté Serene\nTiny Desk Series Editor: Lars Gotrich\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#tinydesk #nprmusic #pjsinsuela \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Capital One.

Saturn is the only competitor for most gorgeous planet with that giant ring system. Hmm… what if we could put the jewel of the Earth in its own ring? Then no contest.  Well, there’s an extremely good chance that Earth once DID have a ring system. At least, that’s the proposal by a recent study that has evidence that a mysterious burst in meteor activity nearly half a billion years ago was actually caused by that ancient ring system collapsing onto the Earth. And, you know, if we had a ring once maybe we can have one again. \n\nCheck Out Joe Scott’s: What Would Happen If The Earth Had Rings?\n\nSign Up on Patreon to get access to this Month’s Livestream Interview with Dr. Matt Caplan!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/pbsspacetime\n\nCheck out the Space Time Merch Store\nhttps://www.pbsspacetime.com/shop\n\nSign up for the mailing list to get episode notifications and hear special announcements!\nhttps://mailchi.mp/1a6eb8f2717d/spacetime\n\nSearch the Entire Space Time Library Here: https://search.pbsspacetime.com/\n\nHosted by Matt O'Dowd\nWritten by Richard Dyer & Matt O'Dowd \nPost Production by Leonardo Scholzer, Yago Ballarini & Stephanie Faria\nDirected by Andrew Kornhaber\nAssociate Producer: Bahar Gholipour\nExecutive Producer: Andrew Kornhaber\nExecutive in Charge for PBS: Maribel Lopez\nDirector of Programming for PBS: Gabrielle Ewing\nAssistant Director of Programming for PBS: John Campbell\n\nSpacetime is a production of Kornhaber Brown for PBS Digital Studios.\nThis program is produced by Kornhaber Brown, which is solely responsible for its content.\n© 2024 PBS.

          "Before the invention of YouTube comments, most people could make remarks that were slightly technically incorrect without fear of immediate public rebuke. The one exception was professors, especially if the classroom included an annoying student such as “Tom 7.” The invention of YouTube was doubly revolutionary: Now anyone can experience being a professor being corrected by an annoying student, but also, corrections can be made years after the fact, and at significant length, as the student cannot be told to “take this offline.” This video is such a lengthy correction and digression, and perhaps itself a fount of mistakes.\n\nDue to the esoteric detail and prodigious whiteboarding, it is almost a “Tom Academy” video. But since I grew a moustache to film it, it qualifies for the Main Sequence.\n\nKeywords: Gradient descent, half-precision floating point, linear operations, F=MA, rounding, exotic transfer functions, machine learning, MNIST, CIFAR-10, chess, fractals, Frobenius, cryptography, fluint8, Motorola 6502.\n\nFor SIGBOVIK 2023.\nPaper, impenetrable code, etc.: http://tom7.org/grad/"

Ultimately I ran 3661 miles in 269 jaunts. It's not a programming video, but you could still think of it as a sort of SIGBOVIK On Ice.\n\nAdditional information, soundtrack, etc. at: http://pac.tom7.org\n\nBy Tom Murphy VII.

This involves making a C compiler that targets the printable subset of x86 (without using self-modifying code), and just barely scraping out solutions to some tricky puzzles that arise due to the constraints. The final result is functionality that is oh so very important, however!\n\nDownload the paper/program and source code: http://tom7.org/abc/\nSIGBOVIK: http://sigbovik.org/\nAll Tom thingies: http://tom7.org/"

I pretend it's because I think Ocarina of Time is beloved for being 3D, and so try to give the 3D treatment to the original Legend of Zelda. But really, Ocarina of Time is a great game, and clumsy 3D is unplayable. I give a bit of tutorial about how the NES and this technique work, and explain how we can use science to automate it.
